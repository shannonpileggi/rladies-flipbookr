# rladies-flipbookr

This content shows how to create code demonstrations in flipbookr with CSS inspired by R-Ladies, and goes with my blog post [R-Ladies styled code gifs with xaringan and flipbookr](https://www.pipinghotdata.com/posts/2021-03-08-r-ladies-styled-code-gifs-with-xaringan-and-flipbookr/). CSS adjustments were kindly developed by Silvia Canel√≥n.

These demos take a while to run because of content `4. haven + gtsummary`.  This is left here for full reproducibility; removing this content will speed up rendering.


* `rladies_default` shows flipbookr output using the default xaringan rladies theme

* `rladies_adjusted_1` shows flipbookr output with modifications on the xaringan rladies theme through a css code chunk in the markdown document (increased font size on code, lighter shade on highlight)

* `rladies_adjusted_2` shows the same modifications, but by calling a separate css sheet rather than using a css code chunk
